					<p>
						A software engineer by trade and a photographer by heart, I find a
						unique synergy between the logical precision of coding and the
						creative freedom of film photography. My journey into photography
						began as a way to disconnect from the digital world, but it quickly
						grew into a passion for capturing fleeting moments and telling
						stories through a vintage lens.
					</p>
					<p>
						I specialize in landscape and street photography, always seeking the
						quiet beauty in everyday scenes. Whether I'm developing a new web
						application or a roll of film, I'm driven by a desire to build
						things that are both functional and beautiful.
					</p>
					<p>
						This space is where my two passions convergeâ€”a gallery of my
						photographic work and a journal of my thoughts on technology,
						creativity, and the art of seeing.
